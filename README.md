## Welcome to Reciprocal Space

Real space is conceptualized by position, distance, and shapes - constitutent pieces of a sense-driven experience which we collectively call reality. These pieces help us make meaning of the world. Recipricol space speaks in the language of frequencies, momenta, and periodicities. It's not an inverse of the material but rather, a representative aspect of stochastic patterns that emerge as a result of collective properties that allow us to conceptualize constituent pieces of a sense-driven experience which we collectively determine to be reality.
